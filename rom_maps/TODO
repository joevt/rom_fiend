ROM notes
---------
- "MacPlusROM.lst.txt" is used by three ROMs "4D1EEEE1 - MacPlus v1", "4D1EEAE1 - MacPlus v2", and "4D1F8172 - MacPlus v3".
- "MacIIROM.lst.txt" is used by two ROMs "9779D2C4 - MacII (800k v2)" and "97851DB6 - MacII (800k v1)" because they have few differences.
- "MacSEROM.lst.txt" is used by two ROMs "B2E362A8 - Mac SE" and "B306E171 - Mac SE FDHD" because mostly only the ".Sony" driver differs.
- "MacLCIIIROM.lst.txt" is used by two ROMs "EC904829 - Mac LC III (older)" and "ECBBC41C - Mac LC III".
- "PB140ROM.lst.txt" and "Quadra700ROM.lst.txt" are identical because the PowerBook 140 and the Quadra 700 use the same ROM "420DBFF3 - Quadra 700&900 & PB140&170".
